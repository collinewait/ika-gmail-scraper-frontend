[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/collinewait/ika-gmail-scraper-frontend.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/collinewait/ika-gmail-scraper-frontend) [![Test Coverage](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/ccb4ed1fac5e66501656/test_coverage)](https://codeclimate.com/github/collinewait/ika-gmail-scraper-frontend/test_coverage)

This app downloads attachments sent by a specific email. I had a couple of attachments sent to me over a long period of time. So I decided to create this app to download them at once.

A working application can can be found [here](https://collinewait.github.io/ika-gmail-scraper-frontend/).
